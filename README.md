# thunderware

You should probably [check this](https://github.com/Lamby777/redstoneware)
first.

This project is basically just Redstoneware except with Zig. The idea is that I
try to get something working using mainly ChatGPT and the docs, and by the end
I'll at least know something about file operations and that sort of stuff. Same
disclaimers as the other readme, DON'T do dumb things with this, and don't use
it against others.
